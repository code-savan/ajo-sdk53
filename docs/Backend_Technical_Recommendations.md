# Ajo App Backend Architecture
## Technical Recommendations

This document outlines my recommended approach for implementing the backend infrastructure for the Ajo savings app, ensuring optimal performance, security, and scalability.

## Core Technology Stack

### Backend Framework: Next.js API Routes

**Recommendation: Next.js API Routes with TypeScript**

Next.js is ideal for the Ajo app backend for several reasons:
1. **Seamless React Native Integration** - Next.js API routes work flawlessly with React Native through RESTful endpoints
2. **TypeScript Support** - Provides type safety and better developer experience
3. **Serverless Architecture** - Easy deployment to Vercel or similar platforms
4. **API Route Organization** - Clean separation of concerns with folder-based routing
5. **Middleware Support** - Built-in support for authentication, logging, and error handling
6. **Edge Functions** - Low-latency global deployments for critical endpoints

Alternative: If you prefer a standalone service, NestJS would be my second recommendation for its robust architecture and modularity.

### Database: Supabase

Supabase is an excellent choice for the Ajo app due to:
1. **PostgreSQL Foundation** - Enterprise-grade relational database
2. **Real-time Capabilities** - Essential for group savings updates
3. **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Critical for financial data protection
4. **Built-in Authentication** - Simplifies user management
5. **Storage Support** - For profile images and documents
6. **Serverless Functions** - For complex database operations

### Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Firebase is indeed the best choice for push notifications because:
1. **Cross-Platform Support** - Works seamlessly on iOS and Android
2. **Integration Simplicity** - Well-documented SDKs for React Native
3. **Topic-Based Messaging** - Perfect for group notifications
4. **Analytics** - Track engagement with notifications
5. **Scheduling** - Set up recurring reminders for contributions

## Architecture Design

### API Layer Structure

```
/api
  /auth              # Authentication endpoints
    /login
    /register
    /verify-email
    /reset-password
  /users             # User management
    /[id]
    /profile
  /groups            # Savings groups
    /[id]
    /create
    /join
    /contribute
  /wallet            # Financial operations
    /balance
    /fund
    /withdraw
    /transactions
  /notifications     # Notification preferences
  /admin             # Admin-only endpoints
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **JWT-based Authentication** with refresh tokens
2. **Supabase Auth** for user management
3. **Role-Based Access Control** for different user types (regular users, group admins, system admins)

### Database Schema (Simplified)

```sql
-- Users
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT UNIQUE,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Wallets
CREATE TABLE wallets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  balance DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
  pending_balance DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Groups
CREATE TABLE groups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  admin_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  contribution_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  frequency TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'
  start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Group Members
CREATE TABLE group_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  position INTEGER, -- position in rotation
  UNIQUE(group_id, user_id)
);

-- Transactions
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'deposit', 'withdrawal', 'contribution', 'payout'
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Payment Processing with Stripe

- Use **Stripe Connect** for handling multi-party payments
- Implement **Stripe webhooks** for payment status updates
- Create a transaction reconciliation system
- Implement proper error handling for failed payments

### 2. Security Measures

- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- Set up **input validation** on all endpoints
- Use **environment variables** for sensitive information
- Implement **audit logging** for financial transactions
- Set up **database encryption** for sensitive fields

### 3. Notification System

- **FCM Topics** for group-based notifications
- **Scheduled Notifications** for contribution reminders
- **Transaction Alerts** for security
- **Email Fallback** for critical notifications

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Implement **caching** for frequent read operations
- Use **pagination** for transaction history
- Set up **database indexes** for common queries
- Implement **background jobs** for heavy operations

## DevOps & Deployment

### Recommended Deployment Strategy

1. **Next.js API Backend**
   - Deploy to Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js
   - Alternatively: AWS Lambda + API Gateway for more control

2. **Database**
   - Use Supabase's managed hosting
   - Set up regular backups
   - Implement database migrations with versioning

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement Sentry for error tracking
   - Set up Datadog or New Relic for performance monitoring
   - Create custom dashboards for business metrics

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Staging environment for pre-production testing
   - Feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Development Workflow Recommendations

1. **API Development**
   - Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Set up Postman collections for testing
   - Implement integration tests for critical flows

2. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
   - Husky for pre-commit hooks
   - SonarQube for code quality analysis

3. **Collaboration**
   - Detailed pull request templates
   - Trunk-based development workflow
   - Feature branch strategy

## Scalability Considerations

The recommended architecture can scale to handle significant user growth:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless API design allows for easy scaling
   - Vercel or AWS Lambda automatically scales based on demand

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Supabase offers read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Consider sharding for very large deployments (millions of users)

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Serverless architecture minimizes costs during low-usage periods
   - Implement caching to reduce database load

## Future Expansion Possibilities

The architecture supports future expansions such as:

1. **Analytics Platform**
   - Integration with data warehouses
   - Business intelligence dashboards

2. **Machine Learning**
   - Fraud detection systems
   - User behavior analysis
   - Savings recommendations

3. **Additional Payment Methods**
   - Cryptocurrency integration
   - Mobile money platforms
   - Bank transfers

## Conclusion

The proposed Next.js API + Supabase + Firebase architecture offers the best combination of development speed, performance, and scalability for the Ajo app. It provides a solid foundation that can grow with your user base while maintaining the reliability needed for a financial application.

The architecture prioritizes:
- **Security** - Critical for financial applications
- **Scalability** - To grow with your user base
- **Developer Experience** - For rapid iteration and maintenance
- **User Experience** - Fast API responses and reliable notifications

This approach minimizes complexity while providing all the features needed for a robust savings platform.
